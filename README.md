# CellPond
CellPond is a weird 'cellular automata' engine that I made for fun.

I've made two videos about it! Check them out:<br>
🦠 [Cells in Cells in Cells](https://youtu.be/gv40Z9tVjAI)<br>
🤖 [Nothing](https://youtu.be/sQYUQNozljo)<br>

## What's the big idea?
CellPond has 2 big ideas:<br>
🐸 You can code it by dragging + dropping shapes.<br>
🐸 Cells can split/merge into bigger/smaller cells.

## How can I use it?
You can try it out at [cellpond.cool](https://cellpond.cool)<br>
(sorry no touch controls yet)

Or, you can download the source code and open `index.html` in a browser.

## How does it work? What do all the shapes do?
It's a secret.
